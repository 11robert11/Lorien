# Lorien Manual v0.2.0

Drawing tablets are supported and reccomended, but you can also just use Keyboard+Mouse. 

## Basic Usage
- Draw with the left mouse button or with your drawing tablet's pen
- Pan/drag across the canvas with the middle mouse button (i recommend to map a button on your pen to the middle mouse button for easy navigation)
- Zoom with mouse wheel
- To select a number of strokes activate the Selection tool and drag across the canvas. By holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> you can add more strokes to your current selection. <kbd>Delete</kbd> deletes all strokes you have currently selected. <kbd>RMB</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> deselects everyting again.
- With the Move Tool you can move your current selection anywhere you want
